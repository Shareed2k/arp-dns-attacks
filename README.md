## ARP-DNS attacks
### Using PCAP library in Linux (for Windows, it would be Winpcap)
------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  The two attacks demonstrated here can be used to poison a victim's ARP cache with which we can sniff/manipulate the packets transmitted between the victim and the local gateway. Please note that these attacks are meant to be carried out in a local network where the attacker's and the victim's systems are connected to the same gateway.
2.  Also note that these are only for educational purpose, but not to gain any kind of profit/pleasure from attacking an unknown person's system in a LAN.

### Tasks
---------
More details on the two attacks shall be updated soon.
