# ARP-DNS attacks

1.  The two attacks demonstrated here can be used to poison a victim's ARP cache with which we can sniff/manipulate the packets transmitted between the victim and the local gateway. Please note that these attacks are meant to be carried out in a local network where the attacker's and the victim's systems are connected to the same gateway.
2.  Also note that these are only for learning how to carry out these attacks, but not to gain profit/pleasure from attacking an unknown person's system in a LAN.

### Tasks
---------
More details on the two attacks shall be updated soon.
